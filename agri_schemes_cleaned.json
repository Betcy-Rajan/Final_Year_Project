        "full_description": "Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state\u2019s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19. \nThe scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of \u201cMukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:\n1.\t\u20b9 5000/- will be provided to each farmer\n2.\tThe number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.\n3.\tThe assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.\n4.\tScheme will be implemented on Direct Benefit Transfer by electronic transfer into the accounts of the beneficiaries.\n5.\tThe Selection of beneficiaries will be done by the District Level Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner of the District. The Principal Secretaries will chair the DLC in the case of BTAD and Autonomous Districts.\n6.\tThe Scheme will be implemented under the overall supervision of the State-Level Monitoring Committee chaired by the Agriculture Production Commissioner.\n<br>\n\n",

Among the livestock species, the pig finds an important place as it is being reared by socio-economically weaker sections of the society especially in the states like Arunachal Pradesh where most of people prefer non-veg cuisines with special attractions for Pork. The pig as compared to other livestock species has a great potential to contribute to a faster economic return to the farmers, because of certain inherent traits like high fecundity, better-feed conversion efficiency, early maturity, and short generation interval. Pig farming also requires small investments in buildings and equipment.\n**Objective**\n\n  - Genetic improvement of the indigenous pigs of Arunachal Pradesh for productivity enhancement by crossbreeding with the exotic breed(s) to a desired level of combination of exotic and local inheritance,\n  - Improvement of indigenous pig rearing by the rural people by selective breeding,\n  - Livelihood earning\n  - Maintenance of well-planned crossbred animals at farmers\u2019 field\n  - Expansion of piggery husbandry and support mechanism to propagate pig rearing in rural areas\n  - Ensure that the breeds introduced, and crossbreds produced and propagated in the state are adapted to local environmental conditions and emerging climatic challenges,\n  - Strengthen support mechanisms and development of the sector in respect of feeding, housing, and health care besides value addition and marketing of the product with value chain development.\n  - Scientific rearing and motivation of farmers for integrated piggery farming.\n\n**Important Features**\n\n  - Seeing the low interest of the actual grass root level farmer for the credit link schemes and their poor success rate, a new venture for piggery development in the state through direct intervention by the Department of AHV&amp;amp;DD, GoAP in terms of upgradation of genetic resources, and other peripherals, a new and innovative scheme is proposed for Budget Announcement 2019-20 for sustainable development and poverty alleviation of Farmers through Pig Rearing in potential districts of Arunachal Pradesh.\n  - Livelihood earning, improvement of indigenous pig rearing by the rural people by selective breeding along with maintenance of well-planned crossbred animals at farmers\u2019 fields.\n  - Expansion of piggery husbandry and support mechanism to propagate pig rearing in rural areas.\n  - Ensure that the breeds introduced, and crossbreds produced and propagated in the state are adapted to local environmental conditions and emerging climatic challenges.\n\n",

The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.\n**2.\tAnti-Hail Net Structure:** Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme \u201cKrishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)\u201d was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna\u201d in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.\n**3.\tGreen House Renovation Scheme:** Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme\u201d in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.\n",

        "full_description": "Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.\n<br>\n\nIt is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State&#39;s flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State&#39;s flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State&#39;s revenue in substantial quantum.\nIt is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.\n<br>\n\n",

The Government has implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the sanitation challenges prevalent in rural areas. The primary focus of this strategy is to encourage and motivate rural communities to abandon the traditional practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation practices. The Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorn Swachata Puruskar (MVSSP) has been introduced as part of this initiative. The MVSSP is an annual competition that aims to identify and recognize the cleanest Gram Panchayat at various levels, including block, district, division, and state. The competition serves as a platform to evaluate the cleanliness and hygiene conditions maintained by Gram Panchayats. Factors such as waste management, sanitation infrastructure, and active community participation are taken into consideration during the evaluation process. The winners of the MVSSP at the state and divisional levels are honored by the Honorable Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh during the Independence Day celebrations each year. Similarly, the district and block-level winners receive prizes from senior dignitaries. This recognition incentivizes Gram Panchayats to maintain high cleanliness standards and continue their efforts towards improved sanitation.\n",

This higher prize amount recognizes the exceptional cleanliness standards achieved by the Gram Panchayat within their division.   1. **State Level:** The highest recognition and incentives are reserved for the winning Gram Panchayat at the state level.
